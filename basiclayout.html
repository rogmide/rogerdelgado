            You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what
            content
            the element contains. The browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret and
            format
            the content.

            There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These are known as empty elements because they
            donâ€™t wrap any content. We will encounter a few of these in later lessons, but for the most part, elements
            will
            have both opening and closing tags.

            HTML has a vast list of predefined tags that you can use to create all kinds of different elements. It is
            important to use the correct tags for content. Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects
            of
            your sites: how they are ranked in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on
            assistive
            technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.
