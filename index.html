            <p>You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what
                content the element contains. The browser can then use that information to determine how it should
                interpret and format the content.</p>
            <p>There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These are known as empty elements because
                they donâ€™t wrap any content. We will encounter a few of these in later lessons, but for the most part,
                elements will have both opening and closing tags.</p>

        <aside>

                This is my sidebar
                <ol>
                    <li>Item1</li>
                    <li>Item2</li>
                    <li>Item3</li>

        <p>HTML has a vast list of predefined tags that you can use to create all kinds of different elements. It is
            important to use the correct tags for content. Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects
            of your sites: how they are ranked in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on
            assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.</p>
